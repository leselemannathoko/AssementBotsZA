#### Front-End

- You are only allowed to use pure `css/scss` to style your pages and that means no css frameworks or libraries e.g `tailwind css`, `bootstrap`... etc, just keep it simple.
- You can make API calls to your back-end in any way you like, you can use the default `RxJs` library or whatever you are comfortable with, we don't judge. 💁🏻‍♂️
